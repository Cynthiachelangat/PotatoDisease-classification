    "# **Potato Disease Classification using CNN**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is one of the most important staple crops worldwide, providing a significant source of nutrition. However, the yield and quality of potato crops are frequently threatened by various diseases, among which early blight and late blight are particularly devastating. These diseases not only reduce crop yield but also increase the cost of production due to the need for disease management and control measures. Early and accurate identification of these diseases is crucial to mitigate their impact and ensure a healthy harvest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, disease detection in potato plants has relied on visual inspection by experienced agronomists or farmers, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. With advancements in computer vision and machine learning, automated systems for plant disease detection have become increasingly feasible. These systems can process large amounts of image data and classify plant conditions with high accuracy, offering a promising solution for early disease detection in potato crops.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research project aims to develop an image classification model to accurately distinguish between healthy potato plants, those affected by early blight, and those affected by late blight. By leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this study seeks to contribute to the broader effort of enhancing agricultural productivity through technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The manual identification of potato plant diseases, such as early blight and late blight, is labor-intensive and subject to human error, leading to delayed or inaccurate diagnosis. These delays can result in significant crop loss and reduced agricultural productivity. There is a critical need for an automated, accurate, and efficient system that can classify potato plant conditions based on leaf images to enable timely intervention and reduce the impact of these diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objectives of this research are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To develop an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can accurately classify potato plant images into three categories: healthy, early blight, and late blight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To collect and preprocess a dataset of potato plant leaf images, ensuring that the dataset is balanced and representative of real-world conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To evaluate the performance of the developed model using appropriate metrics and optimize it for higher accuracy and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To explore the potential applications of the model in real-world agricultural settings, particularly in improving disease management and crop monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Metrics of Success**\n",
    "\n",
    "Target F1-Score:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasonable F1-Score Target: 0.85 or higher\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: An F1-Score of 0.85 indicates that the model has a good balance between Precision and Recall, effectively identifying most diseased plants while keeping false positives in check. Achieving an F1-Score of 0.85 or higher suggests that the model is reliable for practical use in detecting potato plant diseases."
